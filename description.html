            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h4>
                You have two choices. You can create password <span style="color:red"> only with numbers or numbers with letters</span>. Letters can be 
                
                <span style="color:red"> small and big</span>.<br> 
                
                Before you start you have to enter numeric value to determine the length of your password. 
                In case you forget to do this, the app automatically gives 
                
                <span style="color:red">length of password 10 characters</span>. 
                
                After you determined the length you can generate password by clicking the <span style="color:red"> button "Generate...."</span>. 
                If you are not happy of the result you can click the button again to regenerate a new one. You can do this as many times as you want. 
                Also you can clear the password's textbox by clicking the 
                
                <span style="color:red"> button "Clear"</span> and also copy the generated password by 
                
                <span style="color:red"> clicking "Copy"</span>. 
                
                <span style="color:red">Thank you for your patience and goodbye!</span>
